NOTE to HAMED
-------------
The excel file you sent me with data from 2010 to 2014 does not have article titles. Please 
include that. You need to include a column "Title" before the first column in "Qatar_Scopus" sheet.
Then, split the file in three equal parts (-tarek,-sagnik,-hamed) and upload 
the splitted files on github. We will run the codes separately.

to run: python getcitationscopus.py <path to the excel file>
